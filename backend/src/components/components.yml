          - _id: 1
            text: The focus (style) of interactive elements is visible
            help: The focus is usually a ring around an interactive element, that shows what element is selected. To test this, navigate to an interactive example of a dialog inside the documentation. It usually opens with a button of some sort. Click besides it and try to navigate to it with the 'tab' key.
          - _id: 2
            text: Buttons are focusable
            help: All interactive elements should be reachable only using the 'tab' key. You can click buttons with 'enter' or sometimes with 'space'. If you could reach a button with tab, also inside the open dialog, this criteria is fulfilled.
          - _id: 3
            text: The focus does not leave the dialog
            # "The focus is trapped inside the dialog",
            # "With the dialog open, elements outside of the dialog are not reachable"
            # "The focus does not leave the dialog"
            help: The focus should not leave the dialog. This means, all other interactive elements on the page are not reachable with the 'tab' key and are therefore outside of the taborder.

            text: The dialog closes with the `esc` key
